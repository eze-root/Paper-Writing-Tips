## Getting Started

作者总结了如果有一下品质的学生将会 *successful*

1. 广泛阅读、尝试、参与社区。First, they show a willingness to read widely, to explore the field broadly beyond their specific topic, to try things out, and to generally take part in the academic community. 
2. 在某个领域有较大的热情，并且会寻求建议以便将其变成论文的一部分。Second, they have the enthusiasm to develop their interest in some area, and then ask for advice on how that interest can be turned into a thesis project. 
3. 有能力和恒心专注于一个较大的领域。Third, they have the ability and persistence to undertake a detailed (and even gruelling) investigation of a specific facet of a larger topic. 
4. Fourth, they take the initiative in terms of what needs to be done and how to present it, and gradually assume responsibility for all aspects of the research. 
5. Fifth, they are systematic and organized, and understand the need for rigour, discipline, stringency, quality, and high standards. 
6. Sixth, they actively reflect on habits and working practices, and seek to improve themselves and overcome their limitations and knowledge gaps. 
7. Seventh, their work looks plausible; it has the form and feel of high-quality published papers. 
8. Last, they have the strength to keep working despite some significant failed or unsuccessful activity; in a Ph.D., loss of months of work is not unusual.

- [ ] Is your proposed topic clearly a research activity? Is it consistent with the aims and purposes of research?
- [ ] How is your project different from, say, software development, essay writing, or data analysis?
- [ ] In the context of your project, what are the area, topic, and research question? (How are these concepts distinct from each other?)
- [ ] Is the project of appropriate scale, with challenges that are a match to your skills and interests? Is the question narrow enough to give you confidence that the project is achievable?
- [ ] Is the project distinct from other active projects in your research group? Is it clear that the anticipated outcomes are interesting enough to justify the work?
- [ ] Is it clear what skills and contributions you bring to the project, and what will be contributed by your advisor? What skills do you need to develop?
- [ ] What resources are required and how will you obtain them?
- [ ] What are the likely obstacles to completion, or the greatest difficulties? Do you
know how these will be addressed?
- [ ] Can you write down a road map, with milestones, that provides a clear path to the anticipated research outcomes?
- [ ] Do you and your advisor have an agreed method for working together, with a defined schedule of meetings?
